# Summary

[Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) is a networking overlay tool
made by Slack. This repo is creating a rpm package of it.

This repository is primarily created for my own personal use, but if it is
useful for others, good on them.

# Details

Nebula is a [networking overlay tool](https://slack.engineering/introducing-nebula-the-open-source-global-overlay-network-from-slack/)
that lets you connect computers in a way similar to [Tinc](https://www.tinc-vpn.org/)
or [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/).

There exist multiple other projects that are also named "nebula", so choosing
"nebula-overlay-networking" to avoid naming collisions as well as being a bit
more descriptive than just "nebula".
